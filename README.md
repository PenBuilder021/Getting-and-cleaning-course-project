#Getting and Cleaning Data: Course Project
##Introduction
This repository is to present my work for the Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning Data" course project.

##About the data
The data was retrieved from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
It contains features, activity_labels, train and test data.

##About the script and tidy dataset
To use the script 
1. the UCI HAR Dataset must be extracted and
2. the UCI HAR Dataset must be available in a directory called "UCI HAR Dataset".

The train and test datasets are merged, only keeping the mean and standard deviation.
A tidy data set will be written to a file called tidy.txt.
